Hi. im plz4x.
this is my first repo. originally titled programs-from-idle but then i realised id be putting ALMOST ALL of my programs here. so i renamed it.
so yeah. about that idle thing. i mainly programmed in idle even before i signed up for github.
and i also used to program in scratch. over there you could share your games and programs with everyone. i really liked that feature.
a few days before i signed up, i thought, "hey, would be nice if i could share my programs with the world.
"oh wait i can! just use github. also my friends using it too so github would also be an easier way to share programs with each other without going through the trouble of emailing it to him."
and so I did. i signed up for github. and now thats where i am today. now i import my py programs to github.
the end.
:)

P.S. the reason why everything has such funny commit names is because i had no idea what commit names were and so gave them funny names. sorry
